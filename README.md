###2. 📝 Short Description / Purpose
This dashboard is a visually engaging and analytical project that helps users explore real-time weather data from multiple cities.
It focuses on presenting:
Current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed)
Air Quality Index (AQI) and pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, CO, SO2, NO2, O3)
Sunrise & sunset timings
Rain prediction with probability
Forecast for the next 7 days
This project was created to help data enthusiasts and learners understand how to:
✅ Clean and preprocess data (remove duplicates, handle missing values)
✅ Fetch and integrate data from public APIs
✅ Build an interactive, user-friendly dashboard
